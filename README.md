# CRM Customer Segmentation

This project performs basic **unsupervised machine learning** on CRM (Customer Relationship Management) data to segment customers into distinct groups. It uses clustering techniques to identify meaningful customer patterns based on their behavior or features.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Companies often struggle to understand their customer base. By segmenting customers, businesses can target them more effectively, improve retention, and personalize marketing strategies.

## ðŸ§  Approach

- Data preprocessing and exploration using `pandas`, `numpy`
- Data visualization using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- Clustering using unsupervised learning (e.g., **KMeans**)
- Interpretation of cluster results to derive insights

## ðŸ“Š Tech Stack

- Python
- pandas, numpy
- seaborn, matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook

2. Open the notebook in Jupyter:

```
jupyter notebook CRM_Customer_Segmentation.ipynb
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Output
